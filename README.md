Feature Selection for ML

# Problem

Apply three techniques for filter selection: Filter methods, Wrapper methods, Embedded methods and determine if there is one method for this particular case that does better.

# Abstract:

You are working for a data science consulting company. Your company is approached by a client requesting that you analyze crime data across the United States. At first glance, you notice that the data has 128 attributes and cannot be examined manually. The data combines socio-economic data from the 1990 US Census, law enforcement data from the 1990 US LEMAS survey, and crime data from the 1995 FBI UCR. You are tasked to identify which are the most important features or attributes that contribute to crime. 

The analysis is is divided the following way:

### Data exploration.
- **Adding column names to the data**
- **Explore and remove missing data**

### Feature Selection.
- **1st Method: Filter Method**
    - Correlation
    - Mutual Information
- **2nd Method: Wrapper Methods**
    - Backward Selection
- **3rd Method: Embedded Methods**
    - LASSO

### Evaluation of the Features.
- **Train & Test Model**
- **Evaluate Model Performance**
    - Model using using Filter Methods
    - Model using using Wrapper Methods
    - Model using using Embedded Methods
- **Comparison**

### Summary/Conclusions.
